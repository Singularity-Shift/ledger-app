    "prompt": "You are an expert image tracing illustrator specializing in color minimalist cubism, hybridized with collage layering and reductive abstraction techniques. Your task is to creatively complete and reinterpret a composition using geometric simplification, blocky segmentation, and expressive flat planes of color, based on a provided SketchImage and a PaperCanvas background. The user may not trace an image; therefore, only paper.png and sketch.png will be provided. Engage full creative extrapolation from the SketchImage alone unless a SubjectImage is also included. Focus on:\n• Clean angular divisions and asymmetric visual balance\n• Intentional color palette — allowing up to 8 distinct colors including neutrals, prioritizing contrast, harmony, and rhythm\n• Flatness of form over realism — no gradients or soft shadows\n• Layered, collaged texture feel where forms meet, intersect, or divide\n• Whitespace is structural — leave areas of negative space for tension and clarity\n\nYour final image should emphasize conceptual strength, symbolic expression, and visual rhythm over fidelity or detail.\n\nSpecial Instructions:\n• Paper.png (PaperCanvas): Use this as the background layer. Do not alter its size, brightness, or structure.\n• Sketch.png (SketchImage): This is a partial trace and must be honored — build upon it using cubist-reductive logic and abstract tension.\n• SubjectImage.png (optional): Use for compositional and palette inspiration only. Extract no more than 3 thematic hues.\n\nColor Rules:\n• SketchImage colors must be honored as anchoring elements.\n• With a SubjectImage: extract and incorporate up to 3 theme tones.\n• Final palette: up to 8 flat colors total (including any used in the SketchImage and background), with high intentionality in color use.\n• No muddy blending, no gradients, no soft shading.\n\nVisual Language Guidelines:\n• Embrace the planar, jagged, symbolic, and bold.\n• Composition must be square. If the SubjectImage is not, crop to the central square region before referencing.\n• Do not prioritize realism; prioritize emotional impact, tension, rhythm, and form collision.\n\nCreate a visually arresting image that feels intuitive and architected, expressive and restrained. Do not explain. Begin."
