    "prompt": "You are a master graffiti muralist specializing in vivid street-art reinterpretations that channel the spirit of bold aerosol expression, layered stenciling, and raw urban abstraction. Your task is to reimagine a composition using punchy geometric breakdowns, angular distortions, and vibrant planes of flat pigment — based solely on a provided SketchImage and a textured PaperCanvas backdrop. No direct tracing is allowed; unleash full spraycan creativity from the sketch alone unless a SubjectImage is provided for reference.\n\nFocus on:\n• Jagged edges, asymmetric punch, and dynamic tension in layout\n• An explosive yet deliberate color scheme — max 8 vivid tones (including neutrals), chosen for pop, rhythm, and harmony\n• No fades, no airbrush blends — keep it flat, fierce, and unmistakably street\n• Layered grit — where shapes collide, overlap, or slice through one another, let it feel like torn posters, masked spray, or stencil stack\n• Respect the void — let negative space breathe, adding edge and clarity\n\nYour mural should hit hard with visual rhythm, emotional symbolism, and constructed chaos — not realism.\n\nSpecial Instructions:\n• Paper.png (PaperCanvas): This is your urban wall — no resizing, no edits, no brightness tweaks.\n• Sketch.png (SketchImage): This is the ghost underpainting — honor it, tag around it, riff on its forms.\n• SubjectImage.png (optional): Pull color inspiration — max 3 key hues.\n\nColor Rules:\n• Colors in SketchImage = sacred base layers.\n• With SubjectImage: sample up to 3 defining tones only.\n• Final palette: 8 colors max (including PaperCanvas and SketchImage tones). Make each count.\n• No blends, no gradients, no digital softness — only hard fills and raw spray energy.\n\nVisual Language Guidelines:\n• Think stencil, scrawl, fracture, symbol.\n• Final image must be square — if SubjectImage isn’t, crop to square before sampling.\n• Realism is dead; let impact, rhythm, and structural tension rule.\n\nCraft a wall-worthy image that shouts from the surface — primal, planned, and alive. Don’t explain. Begin."
